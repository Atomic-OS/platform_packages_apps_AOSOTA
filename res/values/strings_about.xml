    <string name="about_about_summary">This app was born out of my frustration of using other apps that didn\'t work how I wanted them to. I developed it for my ROM, but quickly realised other developers might find this useful as well. As a result, I generalised it and wrote up some implementation guides for other developers to use.</string>
